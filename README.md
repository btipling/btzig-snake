# btzig-snake
 
 A little demo snake game I made to learn zing and basic intro to modern opengl.
 
 Features:
 * Custom textures I made with aseprite
 * Copyright free sound effects from opengameart.org
 * Directional aware head, tail and snake segments!
 * Multiple different bug types with different sound effects.
 * Imgui for controls, window and text rendering.
